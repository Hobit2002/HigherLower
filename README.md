# HigherLower
A simple terminal game written in Python. For more information read README.md

## Prerequisities
All you need to enter into the world of average gambling game is:
- **Python 3**, no third party libraries are needed. 
- **A terminal which can display symbols such as hearth or diamond properly**

## Rules
(It is not necssary to study this part thoroughly, after the launch, game introduces itself
However, in terms of explaining, more is always better so...)
>>1)To start a game, you have to doubleclick on RunMe.py (or ) a terminal window will pop up and you'll see:
>>-Game rules
>>-Ten cards of which only the first one is turned face up
>>2)You have to corectlly estimate multiple times in a row if the next card will be of higher,lower or equal value than the already turned one. First of all you'll choose how many times, you'll be given this tasks (your choice has to be at least 4 and at most 9), then you'll have to decide how much money you want to bet (you start with 1000â‚¬).
>>3)Time for estimation! Insert your guess and see the turning of the next card. If your guess is incorrect, you'll loose the money you've bet and the turn will end. Otherwise, the game continues.
>>4)If all your guesses are correct, you'll obtain a price worth of the staked sum multiplied by two for each guess. >>5)One turn ends and other starts  

## Codeguide
Since code itself has comments inside which should be enough to explain its structure, I'll describe only shadow of its skeleton here.
